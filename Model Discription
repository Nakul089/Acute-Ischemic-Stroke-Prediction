Contracting Path (Encoder)
Input Shape: (96, 128, 3)
Number of Filters: Starts with 32 and doubles at each downsampling step.
Blocks in the Contracting Path:
Convolutional Blocks: Consist of two convolutional layers followed by optional dropout and max-pooling.
Each Convolutional Layer:
Kernel Size: 3x3
Activation: ReLU
Padding: 'same'
Kernel Initializer: 'HeNormal'
Max Pooling: Halves the spatial dimensions (2x2 pool size).
Expanding Path (Decoder)
Input Shapes: Vary based on the downsampling steps.
Number of Filters: Halves at each upsampling step.
Blocks in the Expanding Path:
Upsampling Blocks: Perform transposed convolutions followed by concatenation with the corresponding contractive path layer.
Transposed Convolution (Upsampling):
Kernel Size: 3x3
Strides: 2x2
Padding: 'same'
Concatenation: Merges the upsampled output with the corresponding contractive path's output.
Two Convolutional Layers after Concatenation:
Similar to the contractive path but operates on the concatenated feature maps.
Output Layer
Output Shape: (96, 128, 23)
Output Layer Details:
Final Convolution: 1x1
Padding: 'same'
Linear Activation ('linear')
Kernel Initializer: 'GlorotUniform'
Number of Output Channels: 23 (representing different classes or segmentation masks)
Model Parameters
Total Number of Layers: 32 (approximate)
